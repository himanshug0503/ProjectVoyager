Long live the branches.

There are three branches in this repository:
Main
Alternate
Dev_Branch


Main:
'Main' is the main branch of the repository. Please do not make any changes to it. This branch contains the code that will go to production.

Alternate:
This is a copy of the 'Main' branch, this will contain the latest changes and only I(Himanshu) will make changes to this. If you need to pull the code, pull it from here. 

Dev_Branch:
'Dev_Branch' is designated for development. Developers should make all changes in this branch and then deploy these changes to Git for code review.
